In project 2, we aim to estimate the announcement effect of Volcker Rule (new banking regulation 
in US) on US banks. More specifically, analyze at least:
- Did the banks decrease their trading assets after the announcement of the new regulation?
- If they responded to the regulation, which banks responded most and which banks least? 

We begin by exploring our data by visualizing the distribution and proportion of our dataset in **_"data_explore.ipynb"_**.

With a better understanding of the data, we performed Propensity Score Matching to identify our Control Group and performed Panel OLS in **_"code.ipynb"_**.
